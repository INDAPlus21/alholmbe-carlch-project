### installation

`npm install` in the root directory <br>
`ts-node index.ts` to run the program from the src directory <br>

## abandoned (go to the crosschain folder instead)

We didn't have time to work on this and the crosschain stuff so this is was not prioritized. However it's still possible to run this program, and it will try to find atomic arbitrages on bsc and print them out to the console. (It will take like 10 minutes for the program to start because it needs to retrieve 1 million pairs.)
